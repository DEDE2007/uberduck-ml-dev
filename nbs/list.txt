55,data/uberduck-multispeakerwavs/56.wav,Rumor has it that Jueyun Karst is the abode of the adepti.,2
56,data/uberduck-multispeakerwavs/57.wav,Perhaps we'll meet the adepti on those cloud piercing mountain peaks.,2
57,data/uberduck-multispeakerwavs/58.wav,"But I wonder, how would one normally communicate with the adepti?",2
58,data/uberduck-multispeakerwavs/59.wav,Hmm. My emergency rations seem to be going bad.,2
59,data/uberduck-multispeakerwavs/60.wav,"Best to consume them quickly. That seems more like a way of getting the attention of a hilichurl, rather than an adeptus.",2
60,data/uberduck-multispeakerwavs/61.wav,To think that the Geo Archon had signed a contract with the Cryo Archon.,2
61,data/uberduck-multispeakerwavs/62.wav,I wonder what the contents of their agreement were.,2
62,data/uberduck-multispeakerwavs/63.wav,"Be that as it may. Since Morax is the god who understands the basis of contracts the best, he's definitely given this some thought.",2
63,data/uberduck-multispeakerwavs/64.wav,"I trust that we will witness the truth, and its denouement play out.",2
64,data/uberduck-multispeakerwavs/65.wav,"I have my guesses. You see, those annual divine predictions have already captured the hearts of the people of Liyue too much.",2

66,data/uberduck-multispeakerwavs/67.wav,What do you think would happen to Liyue if such predictions were available every day?,2
67,data/uberduck-multispeakerwavs/68.wav,"You made, some logical leaps, but that's basically how it is.",2
68,data/uberduck-multispeakerwavs/69.wav,Why am I the only one dying here?,2
69,data/uberduck-multispeakerwavs/70.wav,I suddenly don't feel like exploring these domains.,2

74,data/uberduck-multispeakerwavs/75.wav,"Well, she is the idol of the people of Mondstadt. It's an occupation in which one's work is to be cute, be well loved, and earn a boat load of Mora.",2
75,data/uberduck-multispeakerwavs/76.wav,"That's, one way to put it. Lisa and Amber feel a bit like sisters.",2
76,data/uberduck-multispeakerwavs/77.wav,Amber often runs errands for Lisa. Older siblings asking their younger siblings to do things for them so that they can slack off is a rather common practice.,2
77,data/uberduck-multispeakerwavs/78.wav,But my sister and I are the same age. So we had to decide these things via rock paper scissors.,2
78,data/uberduck-multispeakerwavs/79.wav,"What do you mean? Seriously? Paimon, have you ever seen what Kaeya looks like under that eye patch?",2
79,data/uberduck-multispeakerwavs/80.wav,"So, it would seem he never takes it off.",2
80,data/uberduck-multispeakerwavs/81.wav,"Oh? Really, a secret?",2
81,data/uberduck-multispeakerwavs/82.wav,"Soo, if he ever takes that eye patch off, guess he didn't need to take it off to get a weird nickname.",2
82,data/uberduck-multispeakerwavs/83.wav,What's wrong? How are they alike again?,2
83,data/uberduck-multispeakerwavs/84.wav,"I still don't see it. If one hilichurl could beat, say, three wild boars.",2
84,data/uberduck-multispeakerwavs/85.wav,Then how many hilichurls would it take to reach the fighting prowess of Master Jean and Master Diluc?,2
85,data/uberduck-multispeakerwavs/86.wav,"I'd say that if Diluc strikes first, Master Jean wouldn't be able to counter.",2
86,data/uberduck-multispeakerwavs/87.wav,"There's no way. Yes, but that field would also make Diluc stronger.",2
87,data/uberduck-multispeakerwavs/88.wav,"Diluc would only need a beginner's greatsword to, this is so dumb.",2
88,data/uberduck-multispeakerwavs/89.wav,They both fight for Mondstadt so they wouldn't come to blows.,2
89,data/uberduck-multispeakerwavs/90.wav,"Of course! Kinda like pens but with animal hair at one end for calligraphy, right?",2
90,data/uberduck-multispeakerwavs/91.wav,"So, would you like to make some too?",2
91,data/uberduck-multispeakerwavs/92.wav,Brushes made like that would conduct electricity. I'm not sure we could use them.,2
92,data/uberduck-multispeakerwavs/93.wav,"Besides, Razor isn't a wolf, nor are wolf fur brushes made from actual wolves fur.",2
93,data/uberduck-multispeakerwavs/94.wav,"Well, does Cider Lake look like it's full of cider to you?",2
94,data/uberduck-multispeakerwavs/95.wav,I wonder who makes the better mascot? Paimon or Klee?,2
95,data/uberduck-multispeakerwavs/96.wav,"Wait I forgot. Paimon's not a mascot, Paimon's emergency, little life tips?",2
96,data/uberduck-multispeakerwavs/97.wav,So this is one of the tricks to living in Mondstadt?,2
97,data/uberduck-multispeakerwavs/98.wav,"Pretty impressive. How so? Well, I'm traveling with you.",2
98,data/uberduck-multispeakerwavs/99.wav,"It's not all that different. Still, Oz can also translate for Fischl.",2
99,data/uberduck-multispeakerwavs/100.wav,You on the other hand. How so?,2
100,data/uberduck-multispeakerwavs/101.wav,"Speaking of Fischl, she also claims to be a visitor from another world.",2
101,data/uberduck-multispeakerwavs/102.wav,We're similar in that way. We even bring a pet along with us.,2
102,data/uberduck-multispeakerwavs/103.wav,"But her raven Oz, he looks cool, and is polite to boot.",2
103,data/uberduck-multispeakerwavs/104.wav,More importantly he can both scout and fight. Very useful indeed.,2
104,data/uberduck-multispeakerwavs/105.wav,Maybe I should make arrangements with Fischl to trade companions once in a while.,2
105,data/uberduck-multispeakerwavs/106.wav,"For, say, a week or two at a time.",2
106,data/uberduck-multispeakerwavs/107.wav,It should be quite interesting. With enough experience?,2
107,data/uberduck-multispeakerwavs/108.wav,One also needs to experience trials and setbacks.,2
108,data/uberduck-multispeakerwavs/109.wav,"Maintain an inspirational disposition, one must also have a, mature outlook towards problems.",2
109,data/uberduck-multispeakerwavs/110.wav,Is that the only impression she gives you? Riches?,2
110,data/uberduck-multispeakerwavs/111.wav,"Well, you need an excellent mind. You need to be very familiar with the workings of the markets, you also need to be willing to work really hard.",2
111,data/uberduck-multispeakerwavs/112.wav,"Wait, you're giving up already? That's not a zombie Paimon, that's a vampire.",2
112,data/uberduck-multispeakerwavs/113.wav,Werewolves Paimon. Not zombies. Exercises?,2
113,data/uberduck-multispeakerwavs/114.wav,"Paimon's gone. Well, whatever.",2
114,data/uberduck-multispeakerwavs/115.wav,I'm tired. Let's just sit here for a bit.,2
115,data/uberduck-multispeakerwavs/116.wav,Pyro slimes I suppose. You can feel their warmth just by getting close.,2
116,data/uberduck-multispeakerwavs/117.wav,That's something you'll need in winter. What about you Paimon?,2
117,data/uberduck-multispeakerwavs/118.wav,"Tasty? Well then, I suppose that's one more thing I can eat before you become emergency rations, huh Paimon?",2
118,data/uberduck-multispeakerwavs/119.wav,Do you think that we're too harsh on the hilichurls? I think we're doing more than just kicking it.,2
119,data/uberduck-multispeakerwavs/120.wav,The sleeper tribe? The hilichurls sure have interesting tribe names.,2
120,data/uberduck-multispeakerwavs/121.wav,"Not going to try it yourself, Paimon? Just a little.",2
121,data/uberduck-multispeakerwavs/122.wav,"The, meaty tribe? These hilichurls pick the funniest names.",2
122,data/uberduck-multispeakerwavs/123.wav,What do they pray for? I suppose I should have expected that answer.,2
123,data/uberduck-multispeakerwavs/124.wav,The eclipse tribe. So the hilichurls have normal sounding tribe names like these too.,2
124,data/uberduck-multispeakerwavs/125.wav,"An eclipse symbol. Uh, I was asking you what sort of soup you'd like to have tonight.",2
125,data/uberduck-multispeakerwavs/126.wav,"What's the matter? If this keeps up, you'll one day get caught in a hunting trap with a single Mora as bait.",2
126,data/uberduck-multispeakerwavs/127.wav,Hmm. Won't you be unable to fly if you get fat?,2
127,data/uberduck-multispeakerwavs/128.wav,"Ever eating but never growing. Don't you fail as emergency rations, then?",2
128,data/uberduck-multispeakerwavs/129.wav,"I prefer Paimon. Do you want to give it a go, Paimon?",2
129,data/uberduck-multispeakerwavs/130.wav,Oh? And what did the ocean say?,2
130,data/uberduck-multispeakerwavs/131.wav,"Shall we decide with a game of rock paper scissors, then?",2
131,data/uberduck-multispeakerwavs/132.wav,"Alright then. Rock, paper, what?",2
132,data/uberduck-multispeakerwavs/133.wav,"Sleeping? Reading? Having a, chat with some friends?",2
133,data/uberduck-multispeakerwavs/134.wav,"And thus the Paimon Paradox, famed in the histories of philosophy in Teyvat, was put forth.",2
134,data/uberduck-multispeakerwavs/135.wav,Liyue's cuisine is very different from that of Mondstadt.,2
135,data/uberduck-multispeakerwavs/136.wav,"For example, you can hardly find spicy fried dishes anywhere in Mondstadt.",2
136,data/uberduck-multispeakerwavs/137.wav,That's because you only know one way of cooking them.,2
137,data/uberduck-multispeakerwavs/138.wav,"Well, it's because weasels, by nature, enjoy collecting shiny objects.",2
138,data/uberduck-multispeakerwavs/139.wav,"Well, now that you mention it, Paimon, I wonder. Do you?",2
139,data/uberduck-multispeakerwavs/140.wav,"Paimon, have you ever read Vera's Melancholy before?",2
140,data/uberduck-multispeakerwavs/141.wav,"That book's pretty popular, and I've heard that the author made a tidy sum off of it.",2
141,data/uberduck-multispeakerwavs/142.wav,"A tale of adventure, by Paimon? Ten? Wait, what?",2
142,data/uberduck-multispeakerwavs/143.wav,Um. I've dreamed of falling through endless darkness.,2
143,data/uberduck-multispeakerwavs/144.wav,Without a wind glider. I've also dreamed of my sister walking away from me while I'm unable to catch up to her no matter how fast I run.,2
144,data/uberduck-multispeakerwavs/145.wav,"She tells me that I've come too late. Where do those treasure chasing seelie come from, I wonder?",2
145,data/uberduck-multispeakerwavs/146.wav,Still. Why do I feel a certain sadness every time they touch those treasures?,2
146,data/uberduck-multispeakerwavs/147.wav,It's probably just my imagination. Timmie. His face comes to mind every time I've eaten a sweet madame recently.,2
147,data/uberduck-multispeakerwavs/148.wav,"Really makes it hard to chow down. You're a good teacher, Paimon.",2
148,data/uberduck-multispeakerwavs/149.wav,Who knows? Maybe the quality of your nasty nicknames will improve someday.,2
149,data/uberduck-multispeakerwavs/150.wav,What monster made the deepest impression on you?,2
150,data/uberduck-multispeakerwavs/151.wav,Does a ruin guard really count as a monster? It's more like a machine.,2
151,data/uberduck-multispeakerwavs/152.wav,"Is that so? Well then, I think I'm finally able to classify you now, Paimon.",2
152,data/uberduck-multispeakerwavs/153.wav,"You can be hooked and reeled in. Therefore, you're a fish!",2
153,data/uberduck-multispeakerwavs/154.wav,"Which one? Oh, that? Haven't you seen that a ton already?",2
154,data/uberduck-multispeakerwavs/155.wav,"Well, can you explain how you suddenly appear in front of me, and then disappear just as suddenly?",2
155,data/uberduck-multispeakerwavs/156.wav,Precisely. I believe that the art of putting my weapon away follows the same principle.,2
156,data/uberduck-multispeakerwavs/157.wav,Maybe it's this similarity that makes us such good friends?,2
157,data/uberduck-multispeakerwavs/158.wav,I believe that they were left behind by great travelers who once passed this way.,2
158,data/uberduck-multispeakerwavs/159.wav,"Every time I open one and look at its contents, I can feel a certain kinship with those who came before.",2
159,data/uberduck-multispeakerwavs/160.wav,Something the matter? Huh. That should be the truth.,2
160,data/uberduck-multispeakerwavs/161.wav,"Well, that's also because you love everything that can be eaten.",2
161,data/uberduck-multispeakerwavs/162.wav,"Speaking of looking into people's eyes, I remember one gaze that left a particularly deep impression on me.",2
162,data/uberduck-multispeakerwavs/163.wav,A ruin guard's. Really made me want to poke its eye out.,2
163,data/uberduck-multispeakerwavs/164.wav,"Well, since we're bored either way, wanna imitate the other knights for fun?",2
164,data/uberduck-multispeakerwavs/165.wav,I see you already have the knightly virtue of modesty and politeness. Very impressive. Are there pigeons around?,2

41,data/uberduck-multispeakerwavs/42.wav,Hello!,57
42,data/uberduck-multispeakerwavs/43.wav,What a tale. This will make quite a report for the elves.,57
43,data/uberduck-multispeakerwavs/44.wav,How do you spend your time here in the city?,57
44,data/uberduck-multispeakerwavs/45.wav,"I hate to say this, but he's not a great interview.",57
45,data/uberduck-multispeakerwavs/46.wav,Who doesn't?,57
46,data/uberduck-multispeakerwavs/47.wav,I've made that mistake many times.,57
47,data/uberduck-multispeakerwavs/48.wav,Maybe we can turn it to our advantage. Why not find the statue ourselves? We can fly around and look for it right now!,57
48,data/uberduck-multispeakerwavs/49.wav,"I walk, and I've got little sticks for legs.",57
49,data/uberduck-multispeakerwavs/50.wav,"Now now, don't lose heart.",57
50,data/uberduck-multispeakerwavs/51.wav,What a lovely view!,57
51,data/uberduck-multispeakerwavs/52.wav,"They grow up so fast, don't they?",57
52,data/uberduck-multispeakerwavs/53.wav,Now that you can see me I'll keep you company when Hilda's off with her friends.,57
53,data/uberduck-multispeakerwavs/54.wav,Writing a report on Hilda's school. The elves are very interested in what she does all day.,57
54,data/uberduck-multispeakerwavs/55.wav,Oh yes! Life in the elf counties is quite dull now that you two aren't obliviously stomping on their houses every day.,57
55,data/uberduck-multispeakerwavs/56.wav,I could hardly do otherwise.,57
56,data/uberduck-multispeakerwavs/57.wav,Your mother can be very persuasive.,57
57,data/uberduck-multispeakerwavs/58.wav,Oh look! It's Frida's parents! Perhaps we should go say hi.,57
58,data/uberduck-multispeakerwavs/59.wav,You want me to pick a lock and let a baby troll out of a desk drawer?,57
59,data/uberduck-multispeakerwavs/60.wav,"You certainly like helping trolls, don't you?",57
60,data/uberduck-multispeakerwavs/61.wav,"Yes! For quite some time, actually.",57
61,data/uberduck-multispeakerwavs/62.wav,What about me?,57
62,data/uberduck-multispeakerwavs/63.wav,"Hilda, I'm very fond of you but I'm afraid I must decline.",57
63,data/uberduck-multispeakerwavs/64.wav,"You're, sure, it was elves?",57
64,data/uberduck-multispeakerwavs/65.wav,That seems impossible! I'm the only elf in Trolberg! Unless.,57
65,data/uberduck-multispeakerwavs/66.wav,Unless you've discovered the lost clan of the northern counties!,57
66,data/uberduck-multispeakerwavs/67.wav,"Oh, this is fantastic news!",57
67,data/uberduck-multispeakerwavs/68.wav,It is a thrilling tale!,57
68,data/uberduck-multispeakerwavs/69.wav,"Right, yes, of course.",57
69,data/uberduck-multispeakerwavs/70.wav,"So, I'll tell you on the way!",57
70,data/uberduck-multispeakerwavs/71.wav,Our tale begins in the time of the first elves.,57
71,data/uberduck-multispeakerwavs/72.wav,"Two elf families met at dawn on an ancient plot of land. Their purpose? To execute, a real estate contract.",57
72,data/uberduck-multispeakerwavs/73.wav,Oh yes! Most elf legends are.,57
73,data/uberduck-multispeakerwavs/74.wav,"Both families signed in triplicate, and took it to the king for his approval.",57
74,data/uberduck-multispeakerwavs/75.wav,"Then, disaster struck!",57
75,data/uberduck-multispeakerwavs/76.wav,"The king realized that Bragga, the sellers, had only signed twice!",57
76,data/uberduck-multispeakerwavs/77.wav,In those ancient days it was treason to bring an unfinished contract before the king. He exiled the Bragga family on the spot.,57
77,data/uberduck-multispeakerwavs/78.wav,"The king declared the plot, it remains untouched, neither bought nor sold, to this very day.",57
78,data/uberduck-multispeakerwavs/79.wav,The laws are much fairer now of course.,57
79,data/uberduck-multispeakerwavs/80.wav,If a Bragga signs this contract their exile will be over.,57
80,data/uberduck-multispeakerwavs/81.wav,But unfortunately nobody's been able to find them for generations.,57
81,data/uberduck-multispeakerwavs/82.wav,Let me talk to them.,57
82,data/uberduck-multispeakerwavs/83.wav,"Hello. I am Alfur, of the northern counties.",57
83,data/uberduck-multispeakerwavs/84.wav,"Are you, the lost clan? Really? Then I have fantastic news! Your exile is over!",57
84,data/uberduck-multispeakerwavs/85.wav,It's just one signature!,57
85,data/uberduck-multispeakerwavs/86.wav,Oh! I'm just a good samaritan trying to help where I can.,57
86,data/uberduck-multispeakerwavs/87.wav,"Yes! Yes, I am.",57
87,data/uberduck-multispeakerwavs/88.wav,"Well that's, hardly a, fair interpretation.",57
88,data/uberduck-multispeakerwavs/89.wav,But I don't even know how to ride a rabbit!,57
89,data/uberduck-multispeakerwavs/90.wav,"If you want I could, make you visible to him, it just takes a bit of paperwork.",57
90,data/uberduck-multispeakerwavs/91.wav,They put that clause in every contract. It doesn't actually mean anything!,57
91,data/uberduck-multispeakerwavs/92.wav,Lindworms are very rare and very paperwork averse. It's like saying when cows fly.,57
92,data/uberduck-multispeakerwavs/93.wav,"Oh no, that happens with some regularity.",57
93,data/uberduck-multispeakerwavs/94.wav,The library is a forest for the imagination!,57
94,data/uberduck-multispeakerwavs/95.wav,Found it!,57
95,data/uberduck-multispeakerwavs/96.wav,"Lindworms, habitats and hideouts, volume twenty seven, section three.",57
96,data/uberduck-multispeakerwavs/97.wav,I love a good subject based classification system.,57
97,data/uberduck-multispeakerwavs/98.wav,"Wait, I may have a solution.",57
98,data/uberduck-multispeakerwavs/99.wav,I need a conch shell and a tide chart.,57
99,data/uberduck-multispeakerwavs/100.wav,"Alright, let's see.",57
100,data/uberduck-multispeakerwavs/101.wav,Would you mind? Sorry. Tiny lungs.,57
101,data/uberduck-multispeakerwavs/102.wav,We were hoping you could give us a ride to that island out there.,57
102,data/uberduck-multispeakerwavs/103.wav,Do you really think this is a good idea?,57
103,data/uberduck-multispeakerwavs/104.wav,Who said anything about free?,57
104,data/uberduck-multispeakerwavs/105.wav,"In fact, we're very eager to draw up an arrangement that would be acceptable, to both parties!",57
105,data/uberduck-multispeakerwavs/106.wav,And not devour us?,57
106,data/uberduck-multispeakerwavs/107.wav,"Sign here, and here, and here.",57
107,data/uberduck-multispeakerwavs/108.wav,"Very nice, thank you!",57
108,data/uberduck-multispeakerwavs/109.wav,"Right, we're all set!",57
109,data/uberduck-multispeakerwavs/110.wav,See? All the best legends involve paperwork.,57
110,data/uberduck-multispeakerwavs/111.wav,"The contract is broken, your exile is over!",57
111,data/uberduck-multispeakerwavs/112.wav,"You'd cede your ownership rights just like that? No contract, no lease, no anything?",57
112,data/uberduck-multispeakerwavs/113.wav,It is quite the spectacle!,57
113,data/uberduck-multispeakerwavs/114.wav,Those are all classic symptoms of enchantment!,57
114,data/uberduck-multispeakerwavs/115.wav,"Never, ever ignore a footnote.",57
115,data/uberduck-multispeakerwavs/116.wav,Libraries are thrilling temples of the unexpected!,57
116,data/uberduck-multispeakerwavs/117.wav,"Whoever wrote this book, that's who!",57
117,data/uberduck-multispeakerwavs/118.wav,Guess that's one way to keep your friends forever.,57
118,data/uberduck-multispeakerwavs/119.wav,"No, but there is an asterisk!",57
119,data/uberduck-multispeakerwavs/120.wav,"It's a masterpiece of confusing clauses, that's for sure!",57
120,data/uberduck-multispeakerwavs/121.wav,"Step one, the witch must first perform.",57
121,data/uberduck-multispeakerwavs/122.wav,"I'm afraid, yes. The witch must first perform this chant out loud with vigor, but it only works if you do it at moon rise.",57
122,data/uberduck-multispeakerwavs/123.wav,"Once the disenchantment has begun, it must be completed within an hour in order to take effect!",57
123,data/uberduck-multispeakerwavs/124.wav,There's a footnote to the asterisk of the footnote!,57
124,data/uberduck-multispeakerwavs/125.wav,"Do not forget to feed the disenchanted tide mouse a small morsel of bread at the end, or it will never leave you in peace!",57
125,data/uberduck-multispeakerwavs/126.wav,You're going to seem a lot crazy.,57
126,data/uberduck-multispeakerwavs/127.wav,What's wrong?,57
127,data/uberduck-multispeakerwavs/128.wav,This is precisely why an elf would never make a promise without a written document. That way you can include disclaimers that absolve responsibility in the event the promise cannot be upheld!,57
128,data/uberduck-multispeakerwavs/129.wav,"No, you're protecting yourself against defeat.",57
129,data/uberduck-multispeakerwavs/130.wav,"Sure! You can do it! Statement for encouragement purposes only, you may not actually be able to do it.",57
130,data/uberduck-multispeakerwavs/131.wav,She'll be alright in the end!,57
131,data/uberduck-multispeakerwavs/132.wav,"No, but I know her.",57
132,data/uberduck-multispeakerwavs/133.wav,Mum! Finally! You're back!,57
133,data/uberduck-multispeakerwavs/134.wav,Finally!,57
134,data/uberduck-multispeakerwavs/135.wav,That's not entirely true. I think Twig and I can help.,57
135,data/uberduck-multispeakerwavs/136.wav,I found out who sent the email! And I think I know where to find him.,57
136,data/uberduck-multispeakerwavs/137.wav,"My name is Alfur, of the northern counties. I think you mailed a letter for my friend!",57
137,data/uberduck-multispeakerwavs/138.wav,"Yes! Yes, that's her! Could you tell me where she went?",57
138,data/uberduck-multispeakerwavs/139.wav,Who's dealing?,57
139,data/uberduck-multispeakerwavs/140.wav,She's not here! Well that was six horus of reckless gambling for nothing.,57
140,data/uberduck-multispeakerwavs/141.wav,How ironic! That's what we were hoping you would do.,57
141,data/uberduck-multispeakerwavs/142.wav,Raven! You're here!,57
142,data/uberduck-multispeakerwavs/143.wav,That giant was our last lead.,57
143,data/uberduck-multispeakerwavs/144.wav,And Alfur!,57
144,data/uberduck-multispeakerwavs/145.wav,How peculiar. Anything you want?,57
145,data/uberduck-multispeakerwavs/146.wav,"So, all I have to do is ask for, a blank notebook?",57
146,data/uberduck-multispeakerwavs/147.wav,Simplicity has always been one of my virtues.,57
147,data/uberduck-multispeakerwavs/148.wav,But is this really your house?,57
148,data/uberduck-multispeakerwavs/149.wav,I can fix that.,57
149,data/uberduck-multispeakerwavs/150.wav,"You both need to sign up a disappointment deferral agreement. And we can add in additional clauses that address hidden resentments or blaming tendencies, it's very simple, really.",57
150,data/uberduck-multispeakerwavs/151.wav,And thus we arrive at my own feelings of disappointment.,57
151,data/uberduck-multispeakerwavs/152.wav,My guess is that thing is actually a barghest.,57
152,data/uberduck-multispeakerwavs/153.wav,"Though what it's doing in trolberg is a mystery, barghests usually live deep in the mountains.",57
153,data/uberduck-multispeakerwavs/154.wav,This report will set off a golden age of elf exploration!,57
154,data/uberduck-multispeakerwavs/155.wav,Just think of all the missing paperwork that may have fallen into nowhere space!,57
0,data/uberduck-multispeakerwavs/001.wav,Hey you're third.,58

13,data/uberduck-multispeakerwavs/014.wav,Do you have a leash for that thing?,58
14,data/uberduck-multispeakerwavs/015.wav,Do you have a leash for that thing?,58
15,data/uberduck-multispeakerwavs/016.wav,I feel honored to reward you.,58
